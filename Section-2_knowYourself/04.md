Security Attributes
Confidentiality 
Integrity 
Availability 



Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (the CIA Triad) are the core pillars of information security, guiding policies to protect data by ensuring it's only accessible to authorized users (Confidentiality), remains accurate and trustworthy (Integrity), and is accessible when needed (Availability), forming the foundation for robust cybersecurity strategies


The CIA Triad Explained
Confidentiality: Prevents sensitive data from being disclosed to unauthorized individuals, systems, or processes, using methods like encryption and access controls.
Integrity: Ensures data is complete, accurate, and hasn't been tampered with or altered without authorization, relying on mechanisms like hashing and version control.
Availability: Guarantees that authorized users have reliable and timely access to information and systems when needed, often through redundancy, backups, and disaster recovery
