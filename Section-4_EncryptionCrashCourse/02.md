Hash Functions

A hash function takes as input data of any size.
So it can be an email, a file , or word


In hash function, you can never convert this value from this to the original input

This is a one-way hash function, no keys are required

You just require input, the hash function, and then you get the resulting output which is always of a fixed length depending on the type of function you are using

So this proves integrity and it detects unintentional modifications

It does not provide confidentiality and authentication

HASH Functions 
1. MD2,MD4,MD5
2. HAVAL
3. SHA,SHA-I,SHA-256,SHA-384,SHA-512
