SSL Stripping

SSL Stripping is a cyberattack technique used to downgrade a secure HTTPS connection to an unencrypted HTTP connection, allowing an attacker to intercept, read, or modify data sent between a user and a website. In normal conditions, HTTPS protects users through TLS encryption, ensuring confidentiality and integrity. However, during an SSL stripping attack—often performed in a man-in-the-middle (MITM) scenario such as on rogue Wi-Fi networks—the attacker intercepts the initial request and responds with an HTTP version of the site, while simultaneously maintaining an HTTPS connection with the legitimate server. To the victim, the site may appear normal, but the data transmitted (such as login credentials or session cookies) is actually unencrypted and visible to the attacker. SSL stripping exploits the fact that many users initially type or request a website using plain HTTP, giving the attacker a point to intervene. Modern protections like HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) significantly reduce this risk by forcing browsers to only use HTTPS, even if an attacker attempts a downgrade. Despite this, SSL stripping remains a classic example of how downgrading attacks can break encryption not by cracking it, but by preventing it from ever being used.



An attacker that can position themselves in the middle between the source and the destination of traffic, source being browser and destination being web server, can perform man in the middle attacks. One such attack that required pretty minimal skill is called ssl stripping

ARP spoofing (or poisoning) in cybersecurity involves tricking devices on a Local Area Network (LAN) by sending falsified Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) messages, linking an attacker's MAC address to a legitimate IP address, allowing them to intercept, steal, or redirect traffic, often as a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack to gain credentials or install malware, exploiting ARP's inherent lack of authentication for devices. It's a major threat on IPv4 networks, but solutions include static ARP entries, packet filtering, VPNs, and monitoring tools like Wireshark or Arpwatch.
