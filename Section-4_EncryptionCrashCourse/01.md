Encryption is a method of transforming readable data called plain text into unreadable data called cipher text, which remains confidential and private

Decryption is a method to transform the cipher text into plain text




Symmetric Encryption

Algorithm and Key
Algorithm is publicly known and is scrutinized by many,many people in order to determine if the algorithm is strong and there is a key which is secret and you can think of key like a password that must be secret.


AES = Symmetric Algorithm (Uses 1 Key)

Password becomes the key using something called a key derivation function


256 or 128 = bit length and key space

higher the number is stronger the algorithm
slower to decrypt


Symmetric Encryption Algorithms: 
1. Data Encryption Standard
2. Triple DES
3. Blowfish
4. RC4
5. RC5
6. RCxq
7. Advanced Encryption Standard





Asymmetric Encryption

2 Keys (Public & Private)

Asymmetric Algorithms

1. Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)
2. Elliptic curve cryptosystem
3. Diffie-Hellman (DH)
4. El Gamal


If you encrypt with the private you need the public to decrypt
If you encrypt with the public you need the private to decrypt



Confidentiality
Authentication
Nonrepudiation
Integrity

Features

Asymmetric:
1. Better key distribution
2. Scalability
3. Authentication and NonRepudiation
4. Slow
5. Mathematically intensive


Symmetric:
1. Fast
2. Strong



1024 - bit RSA keys are equivalent in strength to 80-bit symmetric keys
2048 - bit RSA keys are equivalent in strength to 112-bit symmetric keys
3072 - bit RSA keys are equivalent in strength to 128-bit symmetric keys
15360 - bit RSA keys are equivalent in strength to 256-bit symmetric keys

Encrypto


If sender encrypts the data using receiver's public key
and 
receiver decrypts the data using receiver's private key

This ensures confidentiality but not authentication


If sender encrypts the data using its own private key
and
receiver decrypts the data using sender's public key

This ensures authentication but not confidentiality
