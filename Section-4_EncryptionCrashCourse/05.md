HTTPS - (HTTP Secure)


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication


HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the encrypted and secure version of HTTP, designed to protect data as it travels between a user’s browser and a website. It uses TLS (Transport Layer Security) to provide three essential guarantees: confidentiality, ensuring that information such as passwords or payment details cannot be read by others; integrity, preventing attackers from tampering with or altering the data; and authentication, confirming that the user is actually communicating with the legitimate website and not an imposter. HTTPS uses digital certificates issued by trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) to establish this trust, allowing browsers to verify a site’s identity before exchanging sensitive information. Modern websites increasingly enforce HTTPS by default because it prevents common attacks such as eavesdropping, session hijacking, SSL stripping, and data injection. It also enables secure features like HTTP/2, HSTS, and secure cookies. In essence, HTTPS is the backbone of secure communication on the internet, turning the open, vulnerable web into a protected environment suitable for banking, shopping, messaging, and everyday browsing.




Digital Certificates


Digital certificates are electronic credentials that verify the identity of a website, server, or user on the internet. They function like digital ID cards and are a core part of the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), which enables secure communication through encryption and authentication. A certificate contains a public key along with identifying information—such as the domain name, the certificate’s validity period, and the issuing Certificate Authority (CA). When a browser connects to a website, the site presents its certificate, and the browser checks whether it is valid, trusted, and unaltered. If everything matches, a secure TLS connection is established using the public key. This ensures that users are communicating with the legitimate website—not an impostor—and that data exchanged is encrypted and protected from eavesdropping or tampering. Certificates also prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, support secure email, VPNs, and code signing, and uphold the overall trust model of the internet. Without digital certificates, secure web browsing, online banking, and private communication would be fundamentally impossible.
