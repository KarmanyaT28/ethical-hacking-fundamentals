Digital Signatures

A digital signature is a hash value, that is encrypted with the sender's private key to produce the digital signature and the signed message.

It is technically a stamp of approval for the signer.
It is a provider of guarantee over whatever it is that is being signed

When something is digitally signed, it provides authentication because it has been encrypted.

Authentication, non-repudiation, integrity

SSL and TLS

Secure Socket Layer and Transport Layer security

These are cryptographic protocols, designed to provide communication security over a network

SSL is the older encryption protocol
TLS is new , but people still call them SSL
It is sometimes misleading
Many sites still use SSL due to compatibility even though it has security issues.


TLS is used when you see HTTPS
but TLS can be used with any other protocols
TLS is very important for internet security and privacy, because it is most used method for encryption on internet

TLS provides privacy because it encrypts the data and data integrity,
because it used message authentication codes or MACs when communicating between two applications


TLS provides E2E encryption

TLS provides security services like confidentiality or privacy, authentication and integrity

The connection is private because a symmetric algorithm like AES is used to encrypt the data transmitted

The negotiation of a shared secret between the client and the server at the session initiation cannot be read by eavesdroppers even by an attacker who places himself in the middle of the connection


The connection is also reliable in that, no attacker can modify the connection during negotiation without being detected
