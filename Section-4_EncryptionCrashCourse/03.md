Digital Signatures

A digital signature is a hash value, that is encrypted with the sender's private key to produce the digital signature and the signed message.

It is technically a stamp of approval for the signer.
It is a provider of guarantee over whatever it is that is being signed

When something is digitally signed, it provides authentication because it has been encrypted.

Authentication, non-repudiation, integrity
