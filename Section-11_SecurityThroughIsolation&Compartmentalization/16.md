# Security Domains, Isolation, and Compartmentalization

**Security Domains** are logical or physical areas within a system where data and resources share the same security requirements. Each domain enforces policies to control access and protect sensitive information.

**Isolation** is the practice of separating applications, processes, or systems to prevent unauthorized interaction. By isolating components, a compromise in one part does not affect others, limiting the scope of potential attacks.

**Compartmentalization** extends isolation by dividing systems into smaller, self-contained units, often called compartments or security zones. Each compartment operates independently, with strictly defined interactions and access controls. This approach reduces the impact of security breaches, restricts the propagation of malware, and enhances overall system resilience.

Together, security domains, isolation, and compartmentalization form a core strategy in secure system design. They are widely used in operating systems, virtualization platforms, and high-security environments to maintain confidentiality, integrity, and availability, while minimizing the attack surface and limiting damage in the event of a compromise.
