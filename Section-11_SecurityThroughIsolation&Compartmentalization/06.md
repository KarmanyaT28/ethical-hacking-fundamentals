# Built-in Sandboxes and Application Isolation

Built-in sandboxes and application isolation are critical security mechanisms designed to protect systems from malicious or faulty applications. A sandbox provides a controlled environment in which an application can run without impacting the underlying operating system or other applications. Application isolation refers to separating applications so that a compromise in one application does not affect others or the system as a whole. These mechanisms are widely used in modern operating systems, web browsers, and mobile platforms to enhance security and stability. For instance, web browsers like Chrome and Firefox use sandboxes to isolate tabs, while mobile operating systems like Android run each app in its own container with limited permissions. Sandboxes control system access, monitor network requests, and restrict file system interactions to prevent malicious activity. The main benefits include improved security by limiting malware spread, increased stability as crashes are contained, and a safe environment for testing untrusted applications. However, sandboxes are not completely foolproof, as vulnerabilities can allow sandbox escape, and some legitimate app functionality may be restricted. Overall, built-in sandboxes and application isolation are essential tools for maintaining secure and reliable computing environments.
