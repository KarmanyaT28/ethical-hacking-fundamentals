# Qubes OS

Qubes OS is a security-focused operating system designed around the concept of **security by compartmentalization**. It isolates applications and tasks into separate virtual machines called **qubes**, each running its own operating system instance. This approach ensures that a compromise in one qube does not affect others or the core system. Qubes OS supports different types of qubes, including **AppVMs** for user applications, **TemplateVMs** for base system templates, and **NetVMs** for handling network connections. The operating system leverages **Xen hypervisor** technology to manage isolation between qubes efficiently. Key features include strict compartmentalization, secure defaults, disposable qubes for temporary tasks, and integration with Tor or VPNs for anonymity. Qubes OS is widely used by security professionals, journalists, and privacy-conscious users who require strong isolation and protection against malware or targeted attacks. While highly secure, it may have a steeper learning curve and higher hardware requirements compared to conventional operating systems.
