# Virtual Machine Weaknesses

While Virtual Machines (VMs) provide strong isolation and security, they have certain weaknesses that must be considered. VMs can suffer from **performance overhead** due to resource sharing between the host and guest systems, which may result in slower execution compared to running directly on physical hardware. **Hypervisor vulnerabilities** can be exploited, potentially allowing attackers to escape the VM and compromise the host system. VMs also require **considerable system resources** (CPU, memory, and storage), which can limit scalability. Additionally, misconfigurations or outdated software in the VM can introduce security risks similar to those on physical systems. Another concern is **VM sprawl**, where unmanaged proliferation of virtual machines creates complexity and increases the attack surface. Despite these weaknesses, VMs remain a fundamental tool for secure testing, development, and isolated computing environments when managed properly.
