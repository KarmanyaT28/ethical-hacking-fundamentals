# Windows - Sandboxes and Application Isolation: Sandboxie

Sandboxie is a third-party application for Windows that provides sandboxing capabilities to run programs in an isolated environment. It allows users to execute potentially unsafe software without affecting the underlying operating system or other applications. Sandboxie creates a virtual container where all file system and registry changes are confined, ensuring that the main system remains unaffected. This helps prevent malware infections, unauthorized changes, and data corruption. Users can test new applications, browse the internet, or open suspicious files safely within Sandboxie. The sandboxed environment can be easily deleted, making all changes temporary and reversible. While Sandboxie offers strong security and flexibility, it may have compatibility limitations with some software and can incur a minor performance overhead. Overall, Sandboxie enhances Windows security by providing an additional layer of application isolation beyond the native sandboxing features.
