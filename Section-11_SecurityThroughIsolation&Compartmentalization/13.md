# Virtual Machine Hardening

Virtual Machine (VM) hardening involves applying security measures to reduce vulnerabilities and protect both the VM and the host system. Key practices include:

* **Keeping Software Updated:** Regularly update the operating system, applications, and hypervisor to patch security vulnerabilities.
* **Limiting Access:** Restrict administrative privileges and implement strong authentication to prevent unauthorized access.
* **Network Segmentation:** Isolate VMs on separate networks or VLANs to minimize the impact of potential compromises.
* **Disabling Unnecessary Services:** Turn off unused features and services within the VM to reduce attack vectors.
* **Monitoring and Logging:** Enable comprehensive logging and monitor VM activity for suspicious behavior.
* **Using Security Tools:** Deploy antivirus, endpoint detection, and intrusion prevention systems within the VM.
* **Snapshot Management:** Use snapshots cautiously and ensure old snapshots are securely managed to prevent rollback attacks.
* **Resource Controls:** Apply limits on CPU, memory, and disk usage to prevent denial-of-service attacks.

Proper VM hardening enhances security, prevents exploitation, and ensures that virtual environments remain isolated, stable, and reliable for critical operations.
