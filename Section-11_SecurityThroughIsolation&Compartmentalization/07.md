# Windows - Sandboxes and Application Isolation

In Windows, built-in sandboxes and application isolation are key components of system security. Windows Sandbox is a lightweight, temporary desktop environment that allows users to run untrusted applications safely without affecting the main operating system. Each sandbox instance is fully isolated, disposable, and uses hardware-based virtualization to ensure that applications run in a secure environment. Application isolation in Windows is also implemented through technologies like User Account Control (UAC), AppContainer, and Windows Defender Application Guard. These features restrict application permissions, control system access, and prevent malicious software from compromising other applications or critical system resources. Benefits include enhanced security, containment of malware, and safer testing of new or untrusted software. Limitations include potential performance overhead and the possibility of advanced attacks bypassing sandbox restrictions. Overall, Windows sandboxes and application isolation are essential for protecting both system integrity and user data.
