# Mac - Sandboxes and Application Isolation

macOS uses built-in sandboxes and application isolation to enhance security and protect system integrity. Each app on macOS runs within a sandbox that restricts its access to files, system resources, and hardware unless explicitly granted permissions. The **App Sandbox** is a key macOS security feature, which enforces strict access control, limiting applications to only the resources and data they require. This prevents malware or compromised apps from affecting the system or other applications. macOS also uses **System Integrity Protection (SIP)** and **Gatekeeper** to provide additional layers of isolation and security by preventing unauthorized modifications and ensuring apps are signed and verified. Benefits include improved security, reduced risk of malware spread, and safer execution of untrusted applications. Limitations may include restrictions on some legitimate app functionalities and the need for developers to configure sandbox entitlements correctly. Overall, macOS sandboxes and application isolation are essential for maintaining a secure and reliable user environment.
