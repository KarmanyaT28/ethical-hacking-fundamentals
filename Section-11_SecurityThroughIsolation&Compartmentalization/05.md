Dual Boot

Dual booting is a system configuration where a single computer hosts two or more operating systems, allowing the user to choose which one to run at startup. Each operating system is installed on a separate disk partition or drive and operates independently while running. From an isolation perspective, dual booting provides stronger separation than virtual machines because only one operating system is active at a time and there is no shared runtime memory or kernel. This makes dual boot useful for separating trusted and untrusted environments, such as keeping daily-use activities on one OS and security research or sensitive work on another.

In terms of security, dual booting offers partial isolation but not complete separation. While the operating systems do not run simultaneously, they still share physical hardware, firmware (BIOS/UEFI), and bootloaders, which creates potential trust risks. A compromised operating system could theoretically modify the bootloader, firmware, or shared partitions, affecting the integrity of the other OS. For example, malware with disk-level or firmware access on one OS could tamper with boot components used by both systems.

Dual boot is commonly used by developers, security professionals, and students to run Windows and Linux on the same machine for compatibility and learning. It is also used in privacy-focused setups where one OS is hardened and kept offline, while the other handles internet-facing tasks. However, for high-risk threat models, dual booting is often combined with full disk encryption, secure boot, separate physical drives, and strict access controls to strengthen isolation. While dual booting improves separation compared to single-OS setups, it does not replace the security guarantees of full physical isolation or air-gapped systems.
