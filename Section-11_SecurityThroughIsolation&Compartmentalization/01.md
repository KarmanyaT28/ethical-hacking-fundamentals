Introduction to Isolation and Compartmentalization

Isolation and compartmentalization are fundamental principles in cybersecurity and system design aimed at limiting the impact of attacks and containing threats. Isolation refers to separating systems, processes, or networks so that a compromise in one component does not automatically affect others. Examples include running applications in virtual machines (VMs), containers (Docker, Kubernetes), or sandboxes, where each environment operates independently and is restricted from accessing sensitive resources outside its boundary. Compartmentalization involves dividing data, access, or processes into smaller, self-contained segments, ensuring that even if one segment is breached, the attacker cannot access the entire system. Examples include network segmentation using VLANs, separating administrative accounts from user accounts, and data classification with restricted access levels. Together, isolation and compartmentalization reduce attack surfaces, limit lateral movement within networks, and enhance the resilience of IT systems by containing failures, malware, or insider threats within controlled boundaries.
