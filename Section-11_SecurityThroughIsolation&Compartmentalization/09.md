# Linux - Sandboxes and Application Isolation

Linux implements sandboxes and application isolation using various mechanisms to enhance security and system stability. Tools such as **Firejail**, **AppArmor**, **SELinux**, and **namespaces** allow applications to run in restricted environments with controlled access to system resources. Firejail, for example, uses Linux namespaces and seccomp-bpf to isolate applications from the rest of the system, limiting access to files, networks, and devices. SELinux and AppArmor provide mandatory access control policies, enforcing strict rules on what applications can access and modify. Application isolation prevents compromised programs from affecting other processes or the core operating system. Benefits include improved security, containment of malware, and safe testing of untrusted software. Limitations may include configuration complexity and potential restrictions on legitimate application functionality. Overall, Linux sandboxes and isolation mechanisms are essential for maintaining secure and reliable computing environments.
