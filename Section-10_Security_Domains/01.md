Physical Security Domains

Physical security domains are tangible, real-world areas where access to hardware, devices, or sensitive information is controlled. They protect systems from unauthorized physical access, theft, or environmental damage. Examples include server rooms, data centers, office floors, and restricted labs, where security measures like biometric scanners, access cards, CCTV surveillance, security personnel, locks, and fire suppression systems are deployed. Physical security also covers environmental controls such as temperature regulation, humidity control, and backup power systems to prevent accidental damage. For instance, a bank vault or corporate data center represents a high-security physical domain, where unauthorized entry could allow attackers to bypass digital safeguards entirely.

Virtual Security Domains

Virtual security domains are logical or network-based boundaries that protect digital resources and control access in software or cloud environments. They enforce security policies through mechanisms like user authentication, access controls, network segmentation, firewalls, VPNs, encryption, and sandboxed environments. Examples include VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) isolating departments in a corporate network, cloud tenant isolation in AWS or Azure, application sandboxes preventing malware from affecting the system, and role-based access control (RBAC) in enterprise software. Virtual security domains ensure that users, devices, and applications can access only the resources they are authorized for, preventing lateral movement by attackers and protecting sensitive data even if the physical infrastructure is secure.
