What is Phishing, Vishing and SMShing



Phishing

Phishing is a social engineering technique where attackers impersonate trusted entities—such as banks, cloud platforms, universities, or service providers—to trick victims into revealing sensitive information. These attacks are typically executed through deceptive emails containing malicious links, fake login pages, or infected attachments. The goal is to steal credentials, financial data, identity information, or deploy malware. Phishing exploits human trust and urgency, often using tactics like account warnings, payment failures, refund notifications, and security alerts. It remains one of the most common initial access methods in cybersecurity attacks, including ransomware and business email compromise.

Vishing

Vishing (voice phishing) involves using phone calls or VoIP systems to manipulate victims into divulging confidential information or performing actions such as transferring funds or sharing OTPs. Attackers may spoof caller IDs to appear as legitimate institutions (banks, government agencies, customer support). Common vishing schemes include fake tech support, fraudulent “bank verification,” tax threats, and emergency scams. Vishing preys on human emotions—fear, confusion, urgency—and is often combined with data collected from breaches to appear more convincing.

SMShing (SMS Phishing)

SMShing is a form of phishing carried out through text messages. The attacker sends SMS messages that contain malicious links, prompt users to call a number, or request personal information. Messages often claim missed deliveries, payment issues, lottery winnings, or security alerts to trigger fast responses. Since mobile users trust SMS more than email and preview links are not always visible, SMShing remains effective. Clicking the link may lead to credential harvesting sites, malicious downloads, or subscription fraud.
