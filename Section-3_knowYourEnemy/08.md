Darknets

Darknets refer to private overlay networks that require specialized software, configurations, or authorization to access. Unlike the public internet (Surface Web), darknets are not indexed by traditional search engines and allow users to operate anonymously through encryption and relay-routing technologies. The most well-known darknet platform is Tor (The Onion Router), but others include I2P (Invisible Internet Project) and Freenet. While darknets support legitimate uses—such as privacy protection, secure journalism, and whistleblowing—they also attract cybercriminal activity due to anonymity. Criminal actors use darknets to communicate securely, host hidden forums, distribute leaked data, and purchase illicit items with reduced traceability.

Dark Markets

Dark markets are online black marketplaces hosted on darknets where illegal goods and services are bought and sold anonymously. These platforms resemble e-commerce sites with listings, product descriptions, vendor ratings, dispute resolution systems, and cryptocurrency payments, predominantly Bitcoin or Monero. Items traded include drugs, stolen credit cards, forged documents, counterfeit currency, malware subscriptions, ransomware-as-a-service kits, identity data, and hacking tools. Famous examples include Silk Road, AlphaBay, and Hydra Market, many of which have been taken down by global law enforcement operations. Despite periodic shutdowns, dark markets resurface and evolve with stronger security models, decentralized hosting, and vendor-only access policies, contributing to an ongoing cat-and-mouse battle between cybercriminals and authorities.

Exploit Kits

Exploit kits are packaged tools designed to automatically scan for and exploit vulnerabilities in a victim’s system to deliver malware. These kits are typically hosted on compromised websites or malicious advertisements and silently probe browsers, plugins, or OS components for exploitable weaknesses—such as outdated Java, Flash, PDF readers, or unpatched CVEs. Once a vulnerability is found, the exploit kit injects a payload ranging from ransomware and banking Trojans to cryptojackers or spyware. Exploit kits are sold or rented on dark markets under a “malware-as-a-service” business model, enabling low-skilled attackers to execute sophisticated attacks. Notable exploit kits historically include Angler, Blackhole, Nuclear, and Neutrino. Although modern browser security has reduced their prevalence, exploit kits remain a threat, especially against unpatched enterprise systems and legacy software.
