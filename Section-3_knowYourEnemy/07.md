Social engineering - Scams, cons, tricks and fraud

Social engineering refers to the psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or revealing confidential information. Instead of exploiting software vulnerabilities, attackers exploit human emotions such as trust, fear, greed, urgency, authority, and curiosity. Social engineering encompasses a spectrum of scams, cons, tricks, and fraud schemes designed to deceive individuals or organizations. Scams often involve false promises, fraudulent opportunities, or fabricated emergencies that persuade victims to send money, share credentials, or grant access. Cons rely on building trust—sometimes over time—where attackers impersonate colleagues, support staff, or reputable institutions to obtain sensitive data or transfer of assets. Tricks may include pretexting, baiting, fake giveaways, scare tactics, or false technical alerts, leveraging confusion and impulse reactions. Fraud occurs when the deception leads to measurable financial or material loss, such as identity theft, unauthorized purchases, business email compromise, investment fraud, romance scams, or impersonation of government officials. Because social engineering bypasses technical defenses and targets human behavior, it remains one of the most effective entry points for cyberattacks.

CPU Hijackers – Crypto Mining Malware and Cryptojackers

Crypto mining malware, also known as cryptojackers, refers to malicious software that secretly uses a victim’s CPU or GPU resources to mine cryptocurrency without consent. Instead of stealing data or destroying systems, this malware focuses on hijacking processing power to perform complex hashing calculations required to generate digital currency such as Monero, Bitcoin, or Ethereum. Cryptojackers often operate silently in the background, intentionally designed to avoid detection by minimizing resource spikes and adjusting usage based on system activity. They spread through infected websites, malicious browser scripts, compromised cloud instances, Trojans disguised as legitimate applications, and vulnerabilities in containerized environments. For attackers, cryptojacking provides continuous passive income with lower legal risk compared to ransomware or direct theft. For victims, the consequences include degraded system performance, reduced battery life, overheating hardware, increased energy costs, and accelerated component wear. In enterprise environments, cryptojacking can cause cloud cost overruns, operational disruption, and security breaches that indicate deeper unauthorized access. Cryptojacking exemplifies a resource theft cyberattack in which financial gain is achieved through exploitation of computing power rather than theft of data.
