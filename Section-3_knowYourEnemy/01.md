You need security to protect valuable digital assets (data, money, systems) from cybercriminals who exploit vulnerabilities for financial gain, espionage, or disruption, with the "value of a hack" being immense for attackers (ransom money, stolen data) and devastating for victims (financial loss, reputational damage, legal fines), making robust defense crucial for business continuity and customer trust

To stay safe online, focus on using strong, unique passwords with a manager, enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) everywhere possible, and practicing vigilance against phishing/scams by questioning links/attachments and keeping software updated to patch vulnerabilities. These three core practices (strong credentials, MFA, and scam awareness) form the bedrock of personal cybersecurity.

In cybersecurity, a patch is a piece of code that fixes a specific vulnerability, bug, or flaw in existing software or an operating system. Patches are crucial for security because they close security gaps that hackers could otherwise exploit to gain unauthorized access or cause damage. They are often applied through software updates and are essential for protecting systems from threats like malware and ransomware.

Complexity is the enemy of security

Security bugs will always exist as long as humans write softwares
Nowadays, people use AI, will this change the landscape of security bugs??

Security bugs can exist in your operating system, firmware, applications
A particular risk can exist in your browser

Suppose you visit a website which has a special code on it which you can't see.
This code will install malware on your system and take it over through that vulnerability


Known - patch available = GOOD
Unknown - No patch = ZERO DAYS
