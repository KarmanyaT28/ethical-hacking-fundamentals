Malware, Viruses, Rootkits, RATs & Cyber Attack Techniques

Malware (malicious software) refers to any software intentionally created to infiltrate, damage, exploit, or take unauthorized control of computer systems. Attackers use malware for various purposes, including spying, data theft, financial gain, disruption of services, gaining persistent remote access, and damaging systems. Malware comes in several forms, each functioning differently to achieve malicious objectives.

Macro Virus

A macro virus exploits macro scripting languages used in applications such as Microsoft Word and Excel. It infects document files, templates, and spreads through file sharing. When a user opens the infected document, the macro executes automatically, triggering the malicious payload. Macro viruses depend on user actions and often spread through email attachments or shared drives.

Trojans

A Trojan appears legitimate but contains hidden malicious functionality. Unlike worms and viruses, Trojans do not self-replicate. Attackers embed them inside cracked software, free tools, fake updates, or phishing downloads. Trojans are commonly used to steal credentials, install spyware, or create backdoors for remote access. Banking Trojans, downloader Trojans, and Remote Access Trojans are widely observed variants.

Stealth Virus

A stealth virus hides its presence by altering system processes, intercepting OS requests, and modifying responses returned to security tools. It may disguise file size changes or manipulate checksums to avoid signature detection. By remaining hidden, it can persist longer and infect more systems without being noticed.

Firmware Rootkit

A firmware rootkit infects low-level firmware components such as BIOS, UEFI, network cards, or graphics cards. Because firmware operates below the operating system, these rootkits enjoy persistence, surviving OS reinstallation and even certain hardware replacements. Firmware rootkits are difficult to detect and offer attackers complete control before the OS loads.

Remote Access Tool (RAT)

A Remote Access Tool enables attackers to control an infected device remotely. RATs communicate silently with a command-and-control (C2) server, allowing operations such as file transfer, keystroke logging, webcam activation, screen capture, or installing additional malware. While remote administration tools can be legitimate, malicious RATs hide their presence and operate covertly.

Polymorphic Virus

A polymorphic virus continuously changes its internal code structure, encryption keys, or signatures each time it replicates. This mutation makes signature-based antivirus detection ineffective. The virus retains its function but alters its appearance, forcing security tools to rely on behavioral or heuristic analysis.

Worms

A worm is a self-replicating malware that spreads automatically across networks without user involvement. Worms consume bandwidth, overload systems, and can carry destructive payloads. Historical worms like ILOVEYOU and WannaCry caused billions in damage by exploiting vulnerabilities and rapidly propagating across global networks.

Operating System (OS) Rootkit

An OS rootkit installs deep inside the operating system, often in kernel modules or device drivers. By hooking system calls, it hides its own processes, files, and network connections. Rootkits allow attackers persistent, privileged access with minimal visibility and are commonly used in espionage and long-term cyber operations.

Bots and Zombies

A bot or zombie refers to a device infected with malware that allows remote control by an attacker, typically part of a botnet. Botnets are used to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, send mass spam, commit click fraud, or distribute additional malware. The attacker acts as the botmaster controlling thousands or millions of compromised systems.

Self-Garbling Virus

A self-garbling virus obfuscates its code during execution to prevent reverse engineering and analysis. Unlike polymorphic viruses, which mutate their code structure, self-garbling viruses focus on hiding or scrambling instructions in real time to confuse debugging tools and researchers.

Keylogger

A keylogger captures keystrokes typed on a keyboard, and some advanced versions record screen contents, clipboard data, and auto-fill forms. Keyloggers may be installed as software, embedded in firmware, or deployed via hardware USB implants. They are heavily used for password theft, data espionage, and identity compromise.

Ransomware

Ransomware encrypts files, folders, or entire systems and demands payment — usually in cryptocurrency — for a decryption key. Some variants also steal data and threaten public release (double extortion). Infection commonly occurs through phishing emails, malicious attachments, exposed RDP services, or exploit kits. Locker ransomware prevents use of the operating system, while crypto ransomware specifically encrypts stored data.

Malvertisement

Malvertisement (malicious advertising) refers to injecting malware into online advertisements distributed through legitimate ad networks. Users may become infected even without clicking the ad due to hidden scripts, pixel tracking, and exploit redirection. Malvertising often uses flash-based or JavaScript vulnerabilities to compromise browsers.

Drive-by Attack

A drive-by attack occurs when a user simply visits a compromised or malicious website and the system gets infected automatically with no interaction required. The attack leverages browser or plugin vulnerabilities, outdated software, or misconfigured systems. Exploit kits running in the background scan the system and deliver malware silently.
