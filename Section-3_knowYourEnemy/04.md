Spyware

Spyware is a type of malicious software designed to covertly collect information about a user or organization without consent. It records activities such as browsing habits, login credentials, chat logs, emails, and sometimes audio or video using infected hardware. Spyware operates silently in the background and sends collected data to attackers or third-party servers. It is commonly installed through drive-by downloads, malicious attachments, Trojan installers, or bundled software. Spyware is heavily used for identity theft, credential harvesting, corporate espionage, and targeted surveillance.

Adware

Adware is software that displays unwanted advertisements on a user’s system, browser, or applications. Though some adware is legally distributed under “freeware monetization,” malicious adware injects pop-ups, redirects, or auto-launching ads to generate revenue through clicks or tracking. Adware collects data related to user activity, search patterns, and preferences, which can be sold to advertisers. It is frequently bundled with free software, browser extensions, or pirated downloads. Over time, adware not only disrupts user experience but also slows performance and increases exposure to secondary malware infections.

Scareware

Scareware uses fear-based social engineering by displaying false alarms or fake system warnings to persuade users into taking action—such as purchasing fake antivirus software, calling fraudulent support lines, or installing “repair” tools that are malware. It mimics genuine security alerts and often claims that viruses, errors, or privacy risks have been detected. The intent is psychological manipulation; once the user responds, attackers gain payment, credentials, or access to the system. Scareware aligns closely with extortion-based techniques and frequently appears through pop-ups, malicious advertisements, and infected websites.

Browser Hijacking

Browser hijacking modifies browser settings without user authorization, redirecting traffic to specific websites, forcing search engines, or injecting advertisements. It often changes the homepage, default search provider, and new tab settings, making it difficult to revert changes. Browser hijackers track activity, collect personal data, and generate revenue for attackers by redirecting user clicks. They are commonly distributed through malicious extensions, bundled installers, compromised websites, or drive-by downloads. Although not always destructive, hijackers compromise privacy, degrade performance, and increase exposure to phishing or malware.

Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUPs)

Potentially Unwanted Programs are software applications that are not explicitly malicious but behave in undesirable or intrusive ways. PUPs often accompany legitimate software installations, taking advantage of deceptive installers and preselected consent checkboxes. They may alter system performance, track user activity, inject ads, or modify configurations. PUPs blur the line between legitimate software and malware because they exploit user inattention rather than vulnerabilities. Examples include toolbars, trial converters, system optimizers, and bundled browser extensions. Security tools flag PUPs because they impact usability, privacy, and device performance, even though users may technically agree to their installation.
